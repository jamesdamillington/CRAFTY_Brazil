 * Basically, only world residuals are required to implement a global/super-regional market.
 * However, in order to calculate per-cell residuals entire-market-level demands, supplies and
 * number of cells are required. Therefore, these values are passed to the demand model which then
 * has more flexibility to calculate per-cell residuals (e.g. adding noise to some input data).
